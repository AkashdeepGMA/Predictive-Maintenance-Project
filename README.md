# Predictive-Maintenance-Project
I built a Predictive Maintenance Data Science project focused on analyzing machine sensor data to forecast equipment failures. Using techniques like regression analysis, feature extraction, and anomaly detection, I predicted optimal maintenance intervals. The project strengthened my skills in data visualization and statistical modeling.
